# WinRecovery
## About the tool (i dare w8l to copy this tool):
WinRecovery (Old: RecoveryTool) is a multitool, made on: Batch, Python and VBS to help people restore their pc's!
It can (and probably will) run in WinPE if there's python installed (which is almost zero), or use Legacy (Batch-only) version of WinRecovery (coming soon...)
It can run on windows 8 up to latest ones (needs to be python installed). (Sorry winXP+ users)
